An implementation of Checkers in Rust.  Will eventually support multiple
frontends; for now just uses curses.

Eventually this will support any combination of human and AI players.  Currently
just AI... and the AI only chooses random moves.  :)

This was my project of choice to start learning Rust, so a lot of it can be
improved.  PRs welcome.
