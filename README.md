An implementation of Checkers in Rust.  Currently uses a curses frontend, but
should be extendable to other frontends without too much work.

Supports any combination of human and AI players... Though the AI is currently
quite stupid.  :)

This was my project of choice to start learning Rust, so a lot of it can be
improved.  PRs welcome.
